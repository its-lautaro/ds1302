# Library: DS1302
This library was made because I wanted an easy way to interface and use the DS1302 trickle-charge timekeeping chip.

The DS1302 trickle-charge timekeeping chip contains a real-time clock/calendar and 31 bytes of static RAM. It communicates with a microprocessor via a simple serial interface. The real-time clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. The end of the month date is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator (The library only support the 24-hour mode).

Interfacing the DS1302 with a microprocessor is simplified by using synchronous serial communication. Only three wires are required to communicate with the clock/RAM: CE, I/O (data line), and SCLK (serial clock). Data can be transferred to and from the clock/RAM 1 byte at a time or in a burst of up to 31 bytes. The DS1302 is designed to operate on very low power and retain data and clock information on less than 1ÂµW.

The DS1302 is the successor to the DS1202. In addition to the basic timekeeping functions of the DS1202, the DS1302 has the additional features of dual power pins for primary and backup power supplies, programmable trickle charger for VCC1, and seven additional bytes of scratchpad memory.
